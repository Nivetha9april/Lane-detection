# Lane-detection
This project implements real-time lane detection using the BiSeNet (Bilateral Segmentation Network) architecture. BiSeNet is optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for autonomous driving applications. The model segments lane markings from road images to assist in vehicle navigation and control.
